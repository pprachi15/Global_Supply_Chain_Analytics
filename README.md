# ðŸ“¦ Global Supply Chain Analytics

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This project simulates a **Logistics Analyst workflow** using SQL.  
A synthetic shipments dataset was created and analyzed to calculate **key supply chain KPIs**.  

The SQL queries demonstrate:
- **Joins, CTEs, window functions, and CASE logic**  
- **Logistics KPIs** like cost per kilogram, on-time performance, carrier diversification, and lane spend analysis  


## ðŸšš Dataset
The dataset is **synthetic**, modeled after real shipment records:  
- `shipment_id`, `ship_date`, `delivery_promised`, `delivery_actual`  
- `mode` (Truck, Rail, Air, Sea)  
- `origin_city`, `dest_city`  
- `weight_kg`, `total_cost`, `accessorial_cost`  
- `carrier_id`, `carrier_name`  


## ðŸ“Š Key SQL KPIs
1. Cost per kilogram by mode  
2. On-time delivery percent by lane  
3. Average lead time (days)  
4. Carrier scorecard (spend vs. on-time %)  
5. Weekly spend trend (with week-over-week delta)  
6. Accessorial cost share by lane  
7. Mode mix (shipment vs. spend share)  
8. Carrier diversification (share of wallet)  
9. Late shipment buckets (early, on time, 1â€“3 days late, >3 days late)  
10. Pareto analysis of lanes by freight spend

## âš¡ Next Steps
- Scale dataset with open freight/shipping data (Kaggle, US DOT)  
- Build Tableau/Power BI dashboards using exported CSVs  
- Add forecasting SQL for shipment volumes and spend trends
